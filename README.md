## Welcome to my page!

I am a graduate student and researching numerical simulations on typhoons, storm surges, and waves.

I will share the tools that I have made, such as scripts for processing meteorological data, on Github. I look forward to making your work more efficient.

Notably, you are free to use my code and scripts, but I will not be responsible for any problems that may occur in using them.
